# DraftTimerBot

## This bot will be used to time the intervals between draft picks

### Start Up
This starter code currently can connect to a guild and respond to messages based on the category and channel the message
is sent to. Haven't fully implemented the getDelay method/logic, so need help there. I plan to add commands to the discord
client so coaches to be added to the client with their information and unique timer. The .env file does not contain
the bot token or the guild name, so I would advise creating your own bot and server for testing. Please dm me for any
questions about how to move forward.
